            Your holiday shouldn’t start when you arrive at your hotel, it should begin when you check-in at the airport. Getting around Switzerland is part of your adventure. A train journey through the Alps is definitely one for the bucket list and the views will make your jaw drop. And don’t forget to make the most of the cable cars. They’re every single bit as fun as they look.
