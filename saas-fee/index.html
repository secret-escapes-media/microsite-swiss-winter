      <p class="lead-paragraph">Saas Fee is as remote as it gets; only a donkey trail led here until 1951 – so for rustic fayre, this alpine village is idyllic.</p>
      <p>After a tough day scaling the slopes, or hiking the rugged mountain passes, alpine eats are hearty, warming, and filling – basically perfect. A big reason for this is generous servings of cheese, which literally no one could possibly complain about. So, after the novelty of fondue, be sure to seek out authentic raclette, or bratchäs, for your daily dose of cheese overload. To accompany the endless cheese, try your hand at brewing with Gletscher Bräu, a tiny alpine brewery tucked away in Saas Fee. Finally, don’t miss the world’s highest revolving restaurant, Threes!xty, for fine dining and the most breathtaking views in the world.</p>

      <p class="lead-paragraph">Nowhere else in the Alps, nor the world, can you catch as many four-thousanders (peaks greater than 4km) in one glance; Saas Fee is a treasure of high-altitude thrills.</p>
      <p>With plenty of great beginner pistes, Saas Fee is perfect for low-key breaks for those dipping their toes into the perfect ski-holiday. 100km of prepared pistes, with 22 lifts serving them, also gives plenty room for more advanced skiers to strut their stuff too. With a whole valley available for cross country skiing, Saas Fee isn’t just about slopes. Why not pluck up the courage to hang over Gorge Alpine, or tour the place at night, where the frozen waterfalls glisten in the torchlight. For the whole family, speed down the mountain on the Feeblitz bob-sleigh ride, which offers a shot of adrenaline to accompany the stunning views over the nestled village below.</p>

      <p class="lead-paragraph">With activities laid on throughout the day, this traditional alpine village is well prepared to wind you down Swiss style.</p>
      <p>Saas Fee is a far more low-key resort in comparison to Zermatt – its quaint, authentic village feel makes for true relaxation in some of the most stunning scenery in Europe. Due to its remote location, its streets are narrow and bordered by rustic wooden chalets, allowing for very little vehicle traffic. In fact, the only vehicles that navigate the small streets are the occasional taxi or bus, making Saas Fee a haven for uninterrupted walks and wanders, particularly with those little ones in your life. With a selection of spas and bathhouses, you’ll be set for blissed out afternoons taking life in your stride. Aqua Allalin caters particularly well, with saunas built with ceiling to floor windows offering incredible vistas while you kick back.</p>
