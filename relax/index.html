            Switzerland’s chilled-out side can catch people by surprise. With all of the adventurous goings on it’s a wonder that anyone stops to catch their breath. Relaxing doesn’t mean you’ll have time to be bored, there are too many festivals and spas for that to happen. The Swiss idea of taking it easy is more about filling your days with whatever you fancy.
