      <p class="lead-paragraph">This is where Laax really comes into its own, and sets itself apart from your more traditional ski resorts.</p>
      <p>Laax is one of the biggest ski destinations in the Alps. With extensive, varied slopes, there is plenty downhill fun for all abilities, plus special attention paid to the little ones at Ami Sabi Winter Wonderland. Laax is also the home of freestyle, and with four snow parks littered with ramps, rails, boxes and slopes, try your hand at some impressive tricks. At the indoor freestyle centre, you can practice your air time with the benefit of soft pits to land in, before heading to the snow park to give it your best shot. For less extreme adventure, why not grab a sled and slide, skid, and breeze down the mountain in comfort!</p>

      <p class="lead-paragraph">Laax has plenty to offer when you’re not blasting down the slopes – from saunas to museums, unwind here.</p>
      <p>With a treasure of spas and hotel wellness centres accessible to non-guests, there’s no shortage of saunas, jacuzzis and massages to be taken advantage of. Tamina Therme Bad Ragaz is a luxury spot to take advantage of the natural thermal spring in the area, in the footsteps of Nietzsche and Victor Hugo – or take advantage of Laax’s architectural significance by a visit to The Yellow House. For the romantic stargazers among you, don’t miss the Mirasteilas Observatory, the largest public telescope in Switzerland, for a truly breathtaking experience amongst the stars.</p>
