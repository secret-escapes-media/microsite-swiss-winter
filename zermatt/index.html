      <p class="lead-paragraph">From dining at the foothills of the Matterhorn, or having one too many at Zermatt Matterhorn Brewery, Zermatt is rife with great eats and choice tipples.</p>
      <p>This glamorous village has played host to generations of well to do patrons, offering haute dining, Michelin excellence and sumptuous regional delicacies. Combine this with some of the most stunning views in the world, and you have a dining experience like no other. Get stuck-in to a warming fondue inside a cable-car gondola for truly breathtaking panorama, or shack up in a local pub for regional smoked meats and hearty bar snacks – be sure to try a glass of Valais wine too, a must when in Zermatt!</p>

      <p class="lead-paragraph">Zermatt is truly a world leader when it comes to adventure; from ski and snowboarding, to trekking and mountaineering, it’s a veritable playground of outdoor pursuits.</p>
      <p>As the highest ski resort in Europe, and with a bonus stake in snow certainty, Zermatt is synonymous with great skiing. With a vast range of pistes for all levels and abilities, plus plenty schools and tours available, Zermatt is a one-stop destination for whizzing down alpine runs. The landscape is also perfect for long days trekking the winding mountain passes, taking in stunning scenery and building up to a long evening gorging on fondue. For the truly adventurous types, mountaineering is a must, with the Matterhorn standing as a perfect introduction to the sport.</p>

      <p class="lead-paragraph">With a penchant for luxury, Zermatt offers plenty of ways to wind down after a long, action packed day on the slopes.</p>
      <p>With a host of hotels catering to the more opulent stay, and with the majority open for non-guests, there is no shortage of spaces to conserve body, mind and soul – and above all, totally, utterly, relax oneself. With saunas and hammams to help shake off that chill, or the hot outdoor waters of Thermalbad Brigerbad, there’s no reason you can’t get toasty in the depths of winter. Drop in for a spa treatment or a massage, and wonder why you ever came here to ski.</p>
